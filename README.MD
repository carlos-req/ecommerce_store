## 📝 Process

I started with thinking about things I am passionate about and i've always wanted to build my own appeareal store and since I am a big fitness love I thought this would be a great way to combine two loves, building products and fitness.

I started by creating the backend using Node and Express after setting up routes, middleware and controllers, I was ready to connect to MongoDB and starting creating models

In the Front end I created visually appealing screens and made API calls to the backend to retrive authentication information, products and orders.

## 🤔 How Can It Be Improved?

Application could run faster and have more subtle animations with more in depth ecommerce features. A potentially linked up to a checkout / payment page might increase the appeal of this application
